      #### ACN - Cyber Security 

      (Jun 2020 - Present)
      

      Working with large of network data and apply a few business case to detect, visualize and analyze anomaly behaviours. 
      Such as Domain Generated Algorithm (DGA), DDOS, port scanning attempt etc

      #### ACN - Big Data

      (May 2019 – Present)
      
      
      Worked on network big data, cyber security models, with pyspark, trained text 
      classification deep learning models and clustering. 
      We combine external data feed with main data feed to enriched the flow. 
      We had to design and build various processors and workflows, to do ETL, from various input fields to produce useful columns for Analysis. 
      Such as building use cases or monitoring data pattern.

      #### ACN - Forestry

      (Sep 2018 – Jan 2019)
      

      Using Deep Learning & Drone imagery to cover large hectares of plantations to provide current yield and detect areas for improvement to increase yield.
       
      Applied Deep Learning models and methodology on drone images for classification. 
      Used DSM/DTM/NIR/NDVI various imaging technology to detect Tree/ Weed/ Flood /Blankspot 
      from Drone images with geo-referenced information to provide yield forecast and alerts for early intervention

      #### ACN - SKU Detection

      (Jan 2018 – Jun 2018)
      
      
      Improve object detection models for SKUs on shelves that is deployed on mobile phones. 
      This consist of training Image Classification on Caffe, Object Detection on TensorFlow, and evaluating results. 
      Additionally, trained Faster RCNN with in-depth fine tuning and preprocessing.


      The business usecase is to help store owners to quickly do stock taking less manual labor.

      #### National Service

      I was posted to SCS (Specialist Cadet School) after BMT (Basic Military Training). With dedication and peers and commanders support, I voice out and was chosen to Cross Over to OCS (Officer Cadet School), and was posted to Infantry Formation. 
      

      During my service as a Staff Officer at ITI, among other task, I helped facilated an event for then Defense Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen to discuss ICT (In Camp Trainings) and NS men. 


      Later on, I was fortunate to make the cut for AGC (Air Grading Course) to test to be a Pilot. However, during the later circuitry course, I was OOC (out of course) and posted to MTI where I help facilate the ASM (Army Shooting Meet)
