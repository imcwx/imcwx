I was wondering about retirement fund in Singapore for me and my generation folks.


Using the small historical data below:

{{< table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
Year of 55th birthday	|Basic Retirement Sum	|Full Retirement Sum	|Enhanced Retirement Sum
|-|-|-|-|
2016	| $80,500 	| $161,000 	| $241,500 
2017	| $83,000 	| $166,000 	| $249,000 
2018	| $85,500 	| $171,000 	| $256,500 
2019	| $88,000 	| $176,000 	| $264,000 
2020	| $90,500 	| $181,000 	| $271,500 
2021	| $93,000 	| $186,000 	| $279,000
