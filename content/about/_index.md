# More about me 
I have been working on Big Data, Cyber Security, using Machine Learning and Deep Learning (image detection/classification, NLP, Anomaly) to provide business value to our clients.

On the look out for opportunities that can bring my skillset in critical thinking, team player and technical knowledge. Looking for a job that challenging, teaches and have a good mentor. To work for someone with leadership, skills in both functional and technical is important, and also in Life!

As Sustainability is important, it is critical for us to thinking about Energy Efficiencies, Carbon Ecosystem and Food Security. Hope to venture towards creating a World Better for Tomorrow.

Questions, What would be Sustainable in Singapore?
- [SG Green Plan](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/)
- [One Million Trees Movement](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement)
- [Energy, Solar Panel](https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2021/05/singapore-largest-solar-farm-water/index.html?shell)
- Green Cloud - Moving to technology infrastructure to cloud would let cloud services optimizes energy usage 

Is it Enough? Can we leave it to the Government as a Push factor? Is it Enough?
We ought to aim for Carbon Negative, Aim High

### What I want to learn for Work
##### MLOps
###### It is something that can help Manage and use Data from start to finish, while maintaining data intergrity, audit, governance and security, and yet able to be used for Data scientist to do model iterations, testing and transition to deployment.
- Use tools that can help automate model/data management
- Potentially powered by kubenetes/kubeflow, with Jenkins and other automations tool (canary for testing)
- Feature Store?
