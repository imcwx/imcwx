I was wondering about retirement fund in Singapore for me and my generation folks.


Using the small historical data below:

{{< table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
Year of 55th birthday	|Basic Retirement Sum	|Full Retirement Sum	|Enhanced Retirement Sum
|-|-|-|-|
2016	| $80,500 	| $161,000 	| $241,500 
2017	| $83,000 	| $166,000 	| $249,000 
2018	| $85,500 	| $171,000 	| $256,500 
2019	| $88,000 	| $176,000 	| $264,000 
2020	| $90,500 	| $181,000 	| $271,500 
2021	| $93,000 	| $186,000 	| $279,000

And if we take the values above and extrapolate ...
(not including possible inflation)

Yes, that's right. We would need half a million to get the ERS to retire comfortably at 2050. 
As a single adult, it has not included other expenditure from CPF, which are housing or having a kid!


 All the best fellow Singaporeans. Please do give advice on retirement sum. Do we relly on the government saving plan through CPF, do we have to put more in, or do we have to look at alternatives?

Just want to highlight that the retirement sum, whichever catergory would vary from +- 15k to +- 50k.
I think we are at an uncertain time, we the war and global warming crisis. 
What would be Singapore's position be.

p.s - The graph could be combined and overlap is possible, the graph labels are off. 
I think using python plotly with interactive would help better but i am not sure how is that synergy with Hugo.
