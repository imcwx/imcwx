# UNDER CONTRUCTION
###  What is Education to me?
- To equip the next generation with knowledge and skills to be ready for the future of our society, for the world around us. 


### What was Education for in Singapore? (my own interpretation)
- The system was made to churn our workers to quickly go into work force. For exmaple, earlier in the days it was manufacturing. Today, it is more focus on the service sector. Some decisions were made to foucs Bio-Chemistry over Computer Science. And now we have are catching up. 



Well, I do not want to dwell into what it is, but what I feel could be better after entering the work force for a few years ...

### How I think it can be better! 
- Financial Literacy
    - To equip us with the knowledge Singapore's economy, how to manage and plan personal finances, and to understand how the global Economy works and influences us.
    - I guess to also educate the purpose of CPF 
- Singapore's Government Structure
    - I still do not know ..
    - How does the political system works? Carbinet Members, Members of Parliament, NCMPs, NMPs .. what
    - Statutory Boards, how does it work together? 
    - What are the Government Services available to us and what do they do, who and how do they report?
- Improve Sex Education 
    - Stop telling people to practice abstinence but instead educate WHY. What are the consequences? 
    - On top of teaching how to prevent, you should also teach how to have a baby? 
    - The society taboo/shame on sex and masturabtion have to go. 
- Personal grooming / Self-love
    - Understand of self-love, self-care, personal growth. 
    - It is not just about Uniforms. To add on hygiene care, skin care, dietary awareness, healthy lifestyle. 
- Adult "Readiness"
    - To have a Work-Life Balance
    - To contribute back to our World, our Home. 


If you want to build a better World, start with the Education System.
By empowering with the people with worldly fundamentals, can they help to drive the Mindset towards a better Tomorrow.
